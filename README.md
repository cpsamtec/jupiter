### Jupyter Lab

    Extensions have been installed and only need to be enabled. Do not install any further extensions as it will require a full rebuild and always causes problems. If VIM_USER is set to 1 vim will be enabled on the notebook.

    From browser goto 
        On same local network
        - http://ip/lab
        - http://ip:8888
        (ip can be 7 digit balena device uuid.local or actual ip)
        When running on a balena device only
        - https://[balena-device-id].balena-devices.com/lab

### Code Server

    Some extensions have been installed by default. 

    From browser goto
        On same local network
        - http://ip/code
        - http://ip:8080
        (ip can be 7 digit balena device uuid.local or actual ip)
        When running on a balena device only
        - https://[balena-device-id].balena-devices.com/lab

### VSCode

    Make sure to create new coding projects in /code. 

    1. Add following to ~/.ssh/config on your machine
    
    _Host name-whatever_
    _HostName bf3db87.local_
    _User dev_
    _Port 28282_
    _StrictHostKeyChecking no_

    2. Change Host to whatever you want to call environment running on device.
    3. Change Hostname to 7 digit balena device uuid ending with .local or ip address of device. 
    4. Open VSCode on your computer
    5. Make sure Remote - SSH extension installed
    6. Ctrl/CMD+Shift+P REMOTE - SSH: Connect to host
