# Jupiter

A containerized development environment. Can be run on devices supporting amd64/x86_64 or aarch64/arm64v8 using docker-compose or deployed to [balena](https://www.balena.io/) devices. Features include

- [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks
- [jupyter-lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) with prebuilt extensions such as plotly, dash, matplotlib and more
- [code-server](https://github.com/cdr/code-server) VSCode in the browser
- ssh (supporting client key authentication)
- [minio-client](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-client-quickstart-guide.html) (mc) provides commands like ls, cat, cp, mirror, diff, find etc with s3 compatability
- user **dev**
- persistent directories /code, /lab, /home/dev
- i2c, gpio, spi, uart/serial configured to work with dev.
- nginx to expose jupyter, device share, code server over the same port (default 80) with varying routes. Can use ngrok or balena then to make the development environment available publicly.
- preinstalled languages include Rust, C/C++, Python 3 (w/ Poetry & Pipenv), Go, Nodejs (w/ nvm)
- device share service allowing remote discovering, wifi, and network control and monitoring when run on a balena device

## Get Started

1. Requirements
    - Docker
    - Docker Compose
    - Bash
    - Balena (optional)

2. Get Repo
    1. git clone --recursive URL
    2. create a **.env** file in the root directory with the following contents

        ```bash
        #used in notebook service
        JUPI_VIM_USER=0
        JUPI_DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD=dev
        JUPI_OVERRIDE_USER_PASSWORD=dev
        JUPI_CREDENTIAL_VERSION=1
        ```

3. Building

    Build project images using scripts/jupiter.sh. If you do not specify an architecture your current machines will be used. Currently x86_64 and arm64v8 are supported.

    ```bash
    # x86_64
    bash scripts/jupiter.sh build amd64
    # arm64v8
    bash scripts/jupiter.sh build aarch64
    ```

4. Running (optional w/ docker-compose on current machine)

    1. make sure images are built following steps above (_Building_)
    2. get project environment variables from scripts/compose-env.sh

        ```bash
            source scripts/compose-env.sh
        ```

    3. run docker-compose up, down, exec ... commands as usual inside the repo directory.
    4. If you open a new terminal source **scripts/compose-env.sh**

5. Deploying to a device with balena

    1. go to balena console <https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/> and create project jupiter-amd64 or jupiter-aarch64 depending on hardware used
    2. expose environment variables most have default if not set in the console

        - notebook service - have defaults
            - JUPI_VIM_USER=0
            - JUPI_DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD=dev
            - JUPI_OVERRIDE_USER_PASSWORD=dev
            - JUPI_CREDENTIAL_VERSION=1 *increment if any access or secret key environment variables change*
        - notebook service - no defaults
            - JUPI_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
            - JUPI_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

    3. run ```balena login```
    4. make sure images are built following steps above (_Building_)
    5. run jupiter.sh script

        ```bash
        # x86_64
        bash scripts/jupiter.sh deploy amd64
        # arm64v8
        bash scripts/jupiter.sh deploy aarch64
        ```

## Environment address

- When running docker-compose on host the address will be _localhost_ or _127.0.0.1_
- A balena device running the environment can use the first 7 digits of balena id followed by _.local_. example b123456.local. Make sure Bonjour/Zeroconf is installed on the machine you are conecting from
- A balena device IP can be found by going to the balena portal
- On a balena device services of the environment can be accessed remotely at **https://[balena-device-id].balena-devices.com/[service]** when run from a balena device and public access is enabled. See **Jupiter Environment** below

## SSH

- ssh for local network only development
- ssh dev@address -p 28282
- password is _dev_ (configurable w/ JUPI_OVERRIDE_USER_PASSWORD)
- port 28282 only

Jupiter also has support for using public client keys. Generate keys following tutorials online.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
# Place file in ~/.ssh/id_rsa_jupiter
# To copy public key to Jupiter environment
scp -P 28282 ~/.ssh/id_rsa_jupiter.pub dev@jupiter-host-address:~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# Alternativly to append new client
#cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa_jupiter.pub | ssh -p 28282 dev@host_addr "cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

Example setting in ~/.ssh/config to connect simply with ```ssh jupiter```

```bash
Host jupiter
Hostname jupiter-host-addr
User dev
Port 28282
StrictHostKeyChecking no
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_jupiter
```

## WIFI/Network - Jupiter on a Balena device

By default a hotspot is created on wifi enabled devices. Look for WIFI network with name SDC-XXXXXXX where XXXXXXX is the 7 digit balena id. The password can be set/found under environment variables on the balena app dashboard. Look for SDC_WIFI_PASS. This is provided by the **Device Share** service discussed futher at end of the README.

Other useful environment variables are as followed. They can be set in the jupiter-xxxx application section of the balena console <https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/> for the service **sds**.

| Name              | Description                   | Default                                     |

| ETH_DHCP_TIMEOUT  | Timeout to get DHCP address   | 15                                          |
| ETH_LOCAL_TIMEOUT | Timeout to get autoip address | 30                                          |

## Development

### Jupyter Lab

Extensions have been installed and only need to be enabled. Do not install any further extensions as it will require a full rebuild and always causes problems. If JUPI_VIM_USER is set to 1 vim will be enabled on notebook cells.

From a browser goto

- On same local network
  - http://[environment address]/lab
  - http://[environment address]:8888
    (ip can be 7 digit balena device uuid.local or actual ip)
- Remote/Local running on a balena device only with internet access
  - https://[balena-device-id].balena-devices.com/lab

### Code Server

From a browser goto

- On same local network
  - http://[environment address]/code
  - http://[environment address]:8080
    (ip can be 7 digit balena device uuid.local or actual ip)
- Remote/Local running on a balena device only with internet access
  - https://[balena-device-id].balena-devices.com/code

some extensions have been installed by default.

### VSCode

To directly code projects in the Juipter environment from your host machines VSCode app you can do so using the ssh remote extension. Make sure to create new coding projects in /code directory of the Jupiter environment.

1. Configure using instructions from _SSH_. It is preferable to use the public client key configuration, however you can skip the IdentityFile and just use a password.
2. Open VSCode on your computer
3. Make sure Remote - SSH extension installed
4. Ctrl/CMD+Shift+P REMOTE - SSH: Connect to host
5. Enter name-whatever (What you put after Host)

## Minio S3 Client

If the following credentials are set the minio client can be used on s3 (example mc ls s3/)

- JUPI_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- JUPI_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

A device with minio command line client. You can use the command line client **mc** to add/remove buckets and files just as though it were a directory with the only exception you cannot create directories. This is an object store. Examples

- list buckets: ```mc ls s3```
- create bucket tests: ```mc mb s3/tests```
- list file objects in bucket tests: ```mc ls s3/tests```
- copy file to tests: ```mc cp mytest.txt s3/tests```

Further client documentation can be found here
[Minio Client](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-client-quickstart-guide.html)

## Software Tools

The following tools have been installed and are ready to use.

- NVM
- Pipenv
- Poetry
- C/C++
- Rust
- GO

## Docker

On balena devices **/var/run/balena.sock** is exposed. The Jupiter environment also includes docker-compose. This means you can build and run containers from the Jupiter environment. The environment variable DOCKER_HOST will be preconfigured to use this **/var/run/balena.sock**

When running directly on your machine with docker-compose you can expose the docker.sock to the environment by running

```bash
docker-compose  -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-local-sock.yml up
```

The overriding dockerfile mounts the appropriate docker.sock volume. You can create your own overriding docker-compose files to change ports and passwords.

## Environment Variables

For service notebook

- Enable/Disable VIM mode and extensions in Jupyter Lab and Code Server. 0 - Disabled (default), 1 - Enabled
    - JUPI_VIM_USER
- Enable minio client to access AWS S3. ~/.aws/credentials also configured. (ex. mc ls s3/)
    - JUPI_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    - JUPI_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- If credentials are changed (s3) increase this value so the new ones are configured to be used in the environment. Default 1
    - JUPI_CREDENTIAL_VERSION
- Change the build time user password for dev
    - JUPI_DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD
- Change the runtime user password for dev. Will be different than what is in generated image
    - JUPI_OVERRIDE_USER_PASSWORD

## Device Share - Balena

Device share service (/sds/) is used when the environment is running on a balena device to aid in discovery, network/wifi configuration, auto fallback to link-local on eth0 when no dhcp detected, and other various utils such as blinking and rebooting. [Device Connect](https://sdc.ash.samtec.services/sdc/install/) is a client app for your host machine. API route docs can be found at http://[device addr]/sds/docs. Full docs of Device Share can be found at <https://bitbucket.org/samteccmd/samtecdeviceshare/src/master/>. This service
