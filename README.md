# Jupiter

Containerized development environment

## Get Repo

git clone --recursive URL

## Running

- **Balena**. This project has been prebuilt and uploaded to Balnea projects jupyter (arm64v8) and jupyter-x86 (amd64)

- **Docker Compose** (build and run on your machine)

  1. get project environment variables from scripts/env.sh
   
   ```bash
        source scripts/compose-env.sh
    ```

  2. build project images using scripts/jupiter.sh

  ```bash
    # x86_64
    bash scripts/jupiter.sh build amd64
    # arm64v8
    bash scripts/jupiter.sh build aarch64
  ```

  3. now the images are built run docker-compose up, down, exec ... commands as usual inside the repo directory. Make sure if you open a new terminal to source **scripts/env.sh**

## Jupiter Environment

- User is **dev**
- Directories
  - /code persistent directory for coding projects
  - /lab persistent directory for jupyter lab notebook projects
  - /home/dev perisistent home directory for virtual envs and user configuration files
- SSH
  - port 28282
  - on local network only
  - password is _dev_ (will be configurable in future)

## Connecting to Environment

- When running docker-compose on host address will be _localhost_ or _127.0.0.1_
- A balena device running the environment can use the first 7 digits of balena id followed by _.local_. example b123456.local. Make sure Bonjour/Zeroconf is installed on the machine you are conecting from
- A balena device IP can be found by going to the balena portal
- Many services of the environment can be accessed remotely at **https://[balena-device-id].balena-devices.com/[service]** when run from a balena device and public access is enabled. Services include
    - Code Server: In browser VSCode **/code**
    - Jupyter Lab: Python notebooks **/lab**
    - Minio: S3 local bucket server **/minio**

## Local SSH

- ssh for local network only development
- ssh dev@address -p 28282
- password is _dev_ (will be configurable in future)
- port 28282 only

## Credentials

1. ssh onto device
2. bash /app/credentials.sh to get info on running services. tokens etc.

## WIFI/Network - Balena

By default a hotspot is created on wifi enabled devices. Look for WIFI network with name SDC-XXXXXXX where XXXXXXX is the 7 digit balena id. The password can be found under environment variables on the balena app dashboard. Look for SDC_WIFI_PASS. Other useful environment variables are as followed.

| Name              | Description                   | Default                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| SDC_WIFI_TYPE     | enum: HOTSPOT CLIENT DISABLED | HOTSPOT                                     |
| SDC_WIFI_SSID     | WiFi SSID                     | SDC-${**BALENA_PREFIX**_DEVICE_UUID}        |
| SDC_WIFI_PASS     | WiFi passphrase               | samtec1!                                    |
| SDC_WIFI_IFACE    | WiFi hardware interface       | wlan0                                       |
| ETH_DISABLE       | Disable ethernet              | null                                        |
| ETH_TARGET_NAME   | Eth hardware interface        | null                                        |
| ETH_DHCP_TIMEOUT  | Timeout to get DHCP address   | 15                                          |
| ETH_LOCAL_TIMEOUT | Timeout to get autoip address | 30                                          |

## Development

### Jupyter Lab

Extensions have been installed and only need to be enabled. Do not install any further extensions as it will require a full rebuild and always causes problems. If VIM_USER is set to 1 vim will be enabled on notebook cells.

From a browser goto

- On same local network
  - http://ip/lab
  - http://ip:8888
    (ip can be 7 digit balena device uuid.local or actual ip)
- Remote/Local running on a balena device only with internet access
  - https://[balena-device-id].balena-devices.com/lab

### Code Server

From a browser goto

- On same local network
  - http://ip/code
  - http://ip:8080
    (ip can be 7 digit balena device uuid.local or actual ip)
- Remote/Local running on a balena device only with internet access
  - https://[balena-device-id].balena-devices.com/code

some extensions have been installed by default.

### VSCode

Make sure to create new coding projects in /code directory of the Jupiter environment.

1. Add following to ~/.ssh/config on your machine

```bash
Host name-whatever  
HostName xxxxxxx.local
User dev
Port 28282
StrictHostKeyChecking no
```

2. Change Host to whatever you want to call environment running on device.
3. Change Hostname to 7 digit balena device uuid ending with .local or ip address of device.
4. Open VSCode on your computer
5. Make sure Remote - SSH extension installed
6. Ctrl/CMD+Shift+P REMOTE - SSH: Connect to host
7. Enter name-whatever (What you put after Host)
8. password is _dev_ (will be configurable in future)

## Minio S3

A local s3 server is also running on the device with minio command line client. The server is called **myminio**. You can use the command line client **mc** to add/remove buckets and files just as though it were a directory with the only exception you cannot create directories. This is an object store. Examples

- list buckets: ```mc ls myminio```
- create bucket tests: ```mc mb myminio/tests```
- list file objects in bucket tests: ```mc ls myminio/tests```
- copy file to tests: ```mc cp mytest.txt myminio/tests```

Further client documentation can be found here
[Minio Client](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-client-quickstart-guide.html)

A web client can be found using a web browser going to

- On same local network
  - http://ip/myminio
  - http://ip:9000
    (ip can be 7 digit balena device uuid.local or actual ip)
- Remote/Local running on a balena device only with internet access
  - https://[balena-device-id].balena-devices.com/myminio

Credentials can be found in environment keys

- JUPI_MINIO_ACCESS_KEY: default minioadmin
- JUPI_MINIO_SECRET_KEY: default minioadmin

## Software Tools

The following tools have been installed and are ready to use.

- NVM
- Pipenv
- Poetry
- C/C++
- Rust
- GO

## Docker

On balena devices **/var/run/balena.sock** is exposed. The Jupiter environment also includes docker-compose. This means you can build and run containers from the Jupiter environment. The environment variable DOCKER_HOST will be preconfigured to use this **/var/run/balena.sock**

Run directly on your machine with docker-compose you can expose the docker.sock to the environment by running

```bash
docker-compose  -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-local-sock.yml up
```

The overriding dockerfile mounts the appropriate docker.sock volume. You can create your own overriding docker-compose files to change ports and passwords.
